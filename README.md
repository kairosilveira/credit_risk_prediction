# Credit Risk Classification with Home Credit Data


## Overview

This project aims to develop a classification model to predict credit risk using data from Home Credit, a leading financial institution. The dataset contains a wealth of information including client demographics, credit history, and transactional data. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a robust model that accurately predicts whether a client is likely to default on their loan.

## Key Features

- **Classification with Unbalanced Data:** Dealing with the challenge of imbalanced classes where the number of defaults is significantly lower than non-defaults.
- **Integration of Multiple Tables:** Utilizing data from multiple tables provided by Home Credit, including credit bureau data, previous loan applications, and client payment history.
- **Creative Feature Engineering:** Developing new features from existing data to improve model performance, including ratios, aggregates, and domain-specific indicators.
- **Modeling with Ensemble/Boost Models:** Implementing various ensemble and boosting algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and XGBoost to effectively capture complex patterns in the data and enhance predictive performance.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the raw and processed datasets.
- `analysis/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `scr/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `images/`: Images and visualizations used in the project documentation.

## Getting Started
